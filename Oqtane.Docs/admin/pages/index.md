# Pages 

![pageadminbanner](./assets/page-admin-banner.png)

A website is made up of one or more pages. For a page to be functional it should have one or more [modules](../modules/index.html) embedded within it. Options for embedding modules in a page is described in the [Adding Modules to a Page](../modules/adding-modules.html) section.

### Page Theming with Panes

Each page can use a different installed theme if desired. A theme is set up with a certain layout consisting of panes. For example, part of the left side of the pane layout for the default Oqtane theme is shown below. This is only a partial screenshot of the entire set of panes in order to make it readable on this page.

When a module is added to a page, it will be added in any one of the panes within the theme of the page. 

The default Oqtane installation has options for an Oqtane theme or a Blazor theme.
