# Creating a Single Page

[Administrators](../site-administration/role-management.html) have permissions to create a new page in the following two ways.

* From the [Control Panel](../admin-navigation/index.html), click the Add button under the Page Management section
* From the [Admin Dashboard](../admin-navigation/admin-dashboard.html), click the Page Management icon. From the [Page Management](../site-administration/page-management.html) screen, click the Add Page button. 
 
When you create a page, you can set the page metadata, permissions, and theme. These options are described more fully in the [Page Settings](./page-settings.html) description. 

After you create a page, then the page will need to have modules embedded within it in order to be functional. How to add modules is explained in more detail in the [Adding Modules to a Page](../modules/adding-modules.html) section.
