# Control Panel

To view the Control Panel, do the following. 

1. Log into an account as an [Administrator](../site-administration/role-management.html). 
2. Use the [top navigation](./index.html) to select the gear icon in the top right of the page. This should bring up the Control Panel.

[Administrators or content editors](../site-administration/role-management.html) can easily use the Control Panel for much of their daily work. 
The Control Panel offers three main areas for administration, as shown in the annotated screenshot below. 
* The top area of the Control Panel contains a button that opens the [Admin Dashboard](./admin-dashboard.html). The Admin Dashboard allows multiple options for site or host administration. This top area of the Control Panel is visible to [Administrators](../site-administration/role-management.html).
* The middle area of the Control Panel is for [adding a new page](../pages/creating-page.html), editing the [metadata, permissions, or theme](../pages/page-settings.html) of the current page, or deleting or unpublishing the current page. This middle area of the Control Panel is visible to [Administrators](../site-administration/role-management.html).
* The bottom area of the Control Panel is for [adding modules](../modules/adding-modules.html) to the current page. This bottom area of the Control Panel is visible to [Administrators or Content Editors](../site-administration/role-management.html).

It is worth noting that the default Control Panel is one of numerous extension points in Oqtane. Like modules, themes, and other extensions, the Control Panel can be replaced with a custom or third-party alternative.
