### Top Navigation

In the default theme for Oqtane, the upper right part of the header of any given page displays the login name for the currently logged in user and a link for logging out of the site. This is displayed in the annotated screenshot below.

If the logged-in user also has the Host Users or a Administrator role, then two icons are also displayed on the right side of the header. Clicking on the left pencil icon allows the user to edit the page that is currently being displayed. Clicking on the gear icon brings up the Control Panel as a slideout on the right, as discussed below. 


### Control Panel Navigation

The [Control Panel](./control-panel.html) offers three main areas for administration, as shown in the annotated screenshot below. The first option is a button at the top of the Control Panel that opens the [Admin Dashboard](./admin-dashboard.html). The Admin Dashboard allows multiple options for site or host administration. The second option is for [managing the metadata, permissions, and theme of the page](../pages/creating-page.html). The third option for administration is for [adding modules to a page](../modules/adding-modules.html).
