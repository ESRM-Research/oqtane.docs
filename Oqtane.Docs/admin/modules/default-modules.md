# Default Modules

When you install Oqtane, the platform ships with a base set of modules already installed. These modules are categorized into one of three groups. 

* **Common Modules** - These are available both to administrators and to registered users to be able to use on pages that are specified as personalizable, meaning users can modify them as they see fit and they are unique and only viewable to registered users. The [HtmlText module](./htmledit-module.html) is the only default module under this category. 
* **Developer Modules** - The [Module Creator](./creating-modules.html) module is the only default module under this category. The Module Creator will provide a useful pre-built structure and methods for writing code for a custom module.
* **Admin Modules** - These are only available to members who have the *Host Users* or *Administrators* role. The default admin modules are listed below.
