# Adding Non-Default Modules

There is a catalog service at [www.oqtane.net](https://www.oqtane.net) for modules that have not been included in the default installation of Oqtane. 

Oqtane takes the approach of embedding information about the catalog service items into the Oqtane application itself, similar to how many popular applications (e.g., WordPress) give you the ability to find third party plugins or modules from within the admin interface. 

The lists of non-default modules are displayed within the Oqtane instance from within certain admin modules. You can find these non-default modules from the following admin modules. 

* **[Theme Management](../host-administration/theme-management.html)** - The Install Theme button displays a list of non-default themes that can be downloaded and installed
* **[Module Management](../host-administration/module-management.html)** - The Install Module button displays a list of non-default modules that can be downloaded and installed
* **[Language Management](../site-administration/language-management.html)** - The Add Language button brings up a dialog with Manage, Download, and Upload options. Clicking the Download option displays a list of possible languages to install. 

The ability to download more recent versions of Oqtane is available as well. 

* **[System Update]()** - The Download button will download any newer versions of the Oqtane framework 

Note that once any of these options for a new theme, module, language, or system update is installed, then the Oqtane instance will need to be restarted in order to have the new item or update enabled. After new modules are installed, they will usually show up under the Common Modules category in the control panel.
